Merge with the JIT compiler
<p>
The JIT compiler compiles the app in the browser as the app loads. Translation with the JIT compiler is a dynamic process of:
</p>
<p>
Importing the appropriate language translation file as a string constant.
Creating corresponding translation providers for the JIT compiler.
Bootstrapping the app with those providers.
Three providers tell the JIT compiler how to translate the template texts for a particular language while compiling the app:
</p>
<p>
TRANSLATIONS is a string containing the content of the translation file.<br/>
TRANSLATIONS_FORMAT is the format of the file: xlf, xlf2, or xtb.<br/>
LOCALE_ID is the locale of the target language.<br/>
